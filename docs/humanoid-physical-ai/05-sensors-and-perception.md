# 5. Sensors and Perception

Perception is how a robot understands its environment. It relies on a suite of sensors to gather data about the world.

- **Vision:** Cameras (stereo, RGB-D) provide visual input.
- **Proprioception:** Encoders and IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) give the robot a sense of its own body position and orientation.
- **Haptics:** Force and torque sensors allow for a sense of touch and interaction forces.
