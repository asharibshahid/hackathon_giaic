# 6. Actuators and Motion

Actuators are the "muscles" of the robot, converting energy into motion.

- **Electric Motors:** The most common type, including servo motors and brushless DC motors.
- **Hydraulic Systems:** Offer high power density but are more complex.
- **Pneumatic Systems:** Lightweight and compliant, suitable for certain applications.

Motion control algorithms translate high-level goals into precise actuator commands to achieve stable and fluid movement.
