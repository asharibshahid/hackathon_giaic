# 4. Body Architecture and Design

A humanoid robot's body is a marvel of engineering, designed to mimic the human form for compatibility with our environment.

- **Skeleton:** Provides structure and support, often made from lightweight metals or composites.
- **Joints:** Allow for a wide range of motion, from simple hinges to complex multi-axis joints.
- **Degrees of Freedom (DoF):** The number of independent movements a robot can make. Higher DoF allows for greater dexterity.
