# 3. Physical AI vs. Software AI

While both are branches of artificial intelligence, they operate in different domains.

- **Software AI:** Lives in the digital world. Examples include language models, image recognition algorithms, and data analysis tools. Its challenges are primarily computational.
- **Physical AI (Embodied AI):** Interacts with the real world. It must deal with physics, uncertainty, and the complexities of sensory data and motor control. This is where software meets the physical.
